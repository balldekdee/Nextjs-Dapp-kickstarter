# Next.js + React Kickstarter Dapp

In this project, I built a decentralized kickstarter application using web3.js, solidity, Next.js and React. In the process, I learned a great deal on how to enable product-ready interactions between front-end technologies and smart contract solutions.
Building this application was part of the course content for [this](https://www.udemy.com/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/learn/v4/content) udemy course.

## Getting Started

To get a local instance of this project running run the following commands

`npm init`
`npm run install`
`npm run compile`
`npm run deploy`
`npm run dev`

### Prerequisites
```
Node 9.8.0^
```

## Running the tests

Use the command `npm run test`

## Built With

* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - Front-end Framework
* [web3.js](https://maven.apache.org/) - Browser Interface with Smart Contract
* [solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/) - ETH Platform language used to define smart contracts.
